          <p>
            The best wines for steak are full-bodied reds with structure and tannin: <strong>Cabernet Sauvignon</strong>,
            <strong>Malbec</strong>, and <strong>Syrah</strong>. Tannins bind to protein and fat, softening the wine and
            highlighting the meat. Choose Cabernet for classic grilled steak, Malbec for richer cuts, and Syrah for
            pepper or herb crusts. Avoid light reds and most whites — they get lost against the dish.

        <!-- Why it works -->
        <section class="why-it-works" aria-label="Why these wines work">
          <h2>Why It Works</h2>
          <p>
            Steak is high in protein and fat. Red wines with noticeable tannin interact with both: tannins bind to
            protein, reducing astringency and making the wine feel smoother, while the wine’s structure stands up to
            the richness of the meat. Acidity and fruit balance the dish without overwhelming it.

        <!-- Wines to avoid -->
        <section class="wines-to-avoid" aria-label="Wines to avoid">
          <h2>Wines to Avoid</h2>
          <p>
            Light reds (e.g. Pinot Noir in a delicate style) and most white wines tend to be overshadowed by steak’s
            weight and can taste thin or sharp. Very oaky or overly sweet wines can clash with the savory, charred
            character of the meat. Stick to structured, dry reds for best results.

          <h2>Preparation Variations</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Grilled or pan-seared:</strong> Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah match char and crust. <strong>Blue
            cheese or peppercorn sauce:</strong> Bolder Cabernet or Syrah hold up. <strong>Lighter preparations or
            filet:</strong> A structured Merlot or Malbec can work well. Adjust wine weight to sauce and cooking
            intensity.

          <dl>
            <dt>What red wine goes best with steak?</dt>
            <dd>Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, and Syrah are among the best choices. They have enough tannin and body to pair with the protein and fat in steak.</dd>

            <dt>Can you drink white wine with steak?</dt>
            <dd>Most white wines are too light for steak and get overshadowed. Full-bodied whites (e.g. oaked Chardonnay) can work with lighter beef preparations but are not the default recommendation.</dd>

            <dt>Does Malbec go with steak?</dt>
            <dd>Yes. Malbec’s plush fruit and smooth tannins pair well with steak, especially richer cuts like ribeye, and are a classic choice in steakhouse settings.</dd>
