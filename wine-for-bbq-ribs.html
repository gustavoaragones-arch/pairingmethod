        <p>
          The best wines for BBQ ribs match the sauce’s sweetness and the meat’s richness. Zinfandel’s jammy fruit and spice align with sticky, smoky ribs; off-dry Riesling balances sweetness and cuts fat with acidity; Syrah adds pepper and structure for charred, spiced preparations.

      <section aria-label="Why these wines work">
        <h2>Why These Wines Work</h2>
        <p>
          BBQ ribs are high in fat, umami, and often sweetness from sauce. Wine must meet or exceed that sweetness or it tastes thin; acidity and tannin cut through richness. Zinfandel’s ripe fruit and moderate tannin suit American-style ribs; off-dry Riesling is a classic counterpoint; Syrah’s structure works when spice and char dominate.

      <section aria-label="Wines to avoid">
        <h2>Wines to Avoid</h2>
        <p>
          Avoid bone-dry, light-bodied reds or whites—they get overshadowed by sweetness and fat. Very high-alcohol wines can clash with spicy rubs. Stick to wines with some fruit weight or residual sugar when the sauce is sweet.

          <h3>Is red or white wine better with BBQ ribs?</h3>
