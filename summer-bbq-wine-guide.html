    <h1>Summer BBQ Wine Guide</h1>

    <p class="hub-intro">
      Summer BBQ means grilled steak, sticky ribs, and burgers—all high in fat and flavor. Wines need structure and often a touch of sweetness or fruit to stand up to smoke and sauce. Our full <a href="/wine-for-bbq-ribs.html">wine for BBQ ribs</a> and <a href="/wine-with-steak.html">wine with steak</a> guides cover the logic in depth; here we summarize the best categories. Zinfandel and Syrah suit ribs and bold meats; dry <a href="/grapes/riesling.html">Riesling</a> (off-dry for sweet sauce) and Rosé offer refreshment. Browse all <a href="/pairings.html">wine pairing guides</a> for more dishes.

      <tr><td>Grilled steak</td><td><a href="/grapes/cabernet-sauvignon.html">Cabernet Sauvignon</a>, Syrah</td></tr>
      <tr><td>BBQ ribs</td><td>Zinfandel, off-dry <a href="/grapes/riesling.html">Riesling</a>, Syrah</td></tr>

    </table>

    <h2>Grilled Steak</h2>
    <p>
      See our detailed <a href="/wine-with-steak.html">wine with steak</a> guide. In short: <a href="/grapes/cabernet-sauvignon.html">Cabernet Sauvignon</a> and Syrah match char and fat.
    </p>

    <h2>BBQ Ribs</h2>
    <p>
      Sweet or smoky ribs need wines that meet sweetness and cut through richness. Full guide: <a href="/wine-for-bbq-ribs.html">wine for BBQ ribs</a>. Zinfandel and off-dry <a href="/grapes/riesling.html">Riesling</a> lead; Syrah fits dry rubs and smoke.
    </p>

    <h2>Burgers</h2>
    <p>
      Beef burgers with cheese and fixings pair like steak—structured reds. <a href="/grapes/cabernet-sauvignon.html">Cabernet</a>, Syrah, or Malbec work. Lighter toppings can suit <a href="/grapes/pinot-noir.html">Pinot Noir</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Rosé & Refreshing Options</h2>
    <p>
      Dry Rosé with good body suits lighter BBQ and hot days. Chilled lighter reds (e.g. <a href="/grapes/pinot-noir.html">Pinot Noir</a>) can work for casual gatherings.
